# Flutter Navigation and Routing

Sample code that demonstrates:

- Using the `Navigator` to push and pop routes/pages
- Passing data between pages
- Asynchronous programming with `Future` and `async`/`await`
  - Recognizing and handling the "async gap"
- Using `provider` to manage state across pages
